# Ollama-Chat
To make this code work you need:
- Ollama download here https://ollama.com
- any Ollama model here https://ollama.com/search
- replace in the code "Your ollama Model" with the name of your ollama model for example llama3.2
  this code allows you to have your own private chat with your chat bot you can also make the bot play as a personality or just follow your orders
- i personally would take a small modle the size of around 1b to 3b parameters as this would be enough for most users
- this would be perfect for most people: https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2:1b
- If you have any suggestions i would really like to hear them just write them to me
